As we are moving to a more loosely coupled architecture the lightweight releasing of individual apps to azure from git repositories seems like a powerful devops solution.

We are beginning to work out how to make this work with our CI processes and have some great success stories of finding issues or developing features and getting them, spec'd, coded, tested and released to production in, literally, minutes. No waiting around for the 'big bang' release train.
