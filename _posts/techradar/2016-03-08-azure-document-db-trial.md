Azure Document DB is a great way to get going with data problems that fit the Document model really super quickly when you are hosted in Azure.

The model of interaction is 'async' native which is really good when dealing with network IO. The automatic indexing is pretty good and the ability to query these indexes easily in LINQ is also really great. Not sure that all the time ensuring that you could write SQL queries was time well spent, might have put more time into tooling there Microsoft? 

The tooling question is really the thing holding us back from more adoption. It all seems good on paper, but without decent developer tools for interacting with the DB outside of a rudamentory migration tool and the azure portal itself, and NO local dev instances... it's a hard sell, but a compelling potential.
