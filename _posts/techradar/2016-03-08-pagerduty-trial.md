Monitoring and alerting are something we are really getting dirty with at Marketinvoice at the moment and we are trialling a number of products to help us manage this.

One of these is pagerduty, it allows a team to specifiy rules for notifiying it's members about potential production issues. You can create shifts for 'on call' engineers and escalation rules.

We love the slack integration, but are not using it to SMS engineers outside of operational hours, which is exactly what we want! But maybe this is a sledgehammer where we need a rubber mallet.

Alerting is hard. When. Why. And how. Are all really important striking a balance between 'crying wolf' and 'nobody knew' is hard but PagrDuty is helping us get there.
