## What is it?

Flow is the at the core of lean thinking. Minimising the time taken from inception of an idea to delivery will improve quality, lower costs, and improve response times.

## Why should we care?

1. Focus on quality
2. Enhances flexibility
3. Reduces Inventory
4. Improves Morale
5. Minimises Risk
6. Improves Productivity

## How can it do this?

Focusing on getting single items through to the customer as quickly as possible can be thought of as reducing the water flowing in a river. As the water level drops we see the stones and shopping trolleys sticking above the water. These are the items in our process that impede the flow of deliverables, just as our abandoned shopping trolley impedes the passage of the water. By surfacing the problems you have to deal with them or stop delivering. Focusing on the flow you expose inefficiencies in the process that demand immediate resolution. When working on multiple items the general noise can mask the inefficiencies and people will come to accept that it takes at least a week to fix anything. Identifying defects in single pieces of work is far quicker and easier than sifting through 10 or 20 when they are shipped.

By optimising for flow, we build in quality to our products and processes, we have to or there will be no flow just a series of bottlenecks and delays.

If only working on one item at a time and then the time for that item to be through the pipeline and delivered is minimised, and therefor the time before we can focus on another different piece of work is also minimised. In stead of months till the next planning session or 2 weeks till the next sprint; the time to implementation is: we'll do it next. A defect can be corrected in hours rather than weeks. This is the ultimate in flexibility.

If we are concerned with delivering the unit we are working on as quickly as possible then the work does not sit around gathering dust; which is wasteful. As soon as we have completed the work it is delivered to the end user for them to start gaining immediate benefit from it. 

Shipping products, code or fixes out to the customer with a regular cadence improves morale, of the delivery team and the customer. The product is continually improving, the time to fix the most critical issues are minimised. The flexibility allows for a responsive organisation.

Reducing the number of items shipped per delivery reduces the risk. In our environment shipping one item at a time means if we have made an error we should only be breaking one area of business or end-user functionality. If we have shipped 10 items then potentially we could break 10 things, or have no idea what the correlation between items shipped and error logs were. 

A focus on flow builds to a improvement in productivity. Identifying and removing obstacles minimises waste in the system, identifying quality problems early stops them being shipped to the customer, reducing the items shipped together leads to quicker defect resolution when things slip through the net. All this leads to a team that delivers value to the customer quickly and efficiently which build morale. Happy teams build focused on flow develop into highly productive teams: that can rapidly deliver the highest priority items to the customer and change focus rapidly.

## So why focus on flow?

Why would you not!
