There are myriad ways to run retrospectives, and if you are ever lacking a retro or wish to mix things up please check out this amazing resource: http://retrospectivewiki.org/ - From Rob Bowley.

General format is:

* Review actions from last retro
* Discuss the last period of time (week, fortnight, month, project)
* Generate ideas
* Filter/vote
* Discuss and generate actions/experiments

In this post I am going look at the Generate ideas section of my personal favourite retrospective.  It is the "Stop, Start, Continue Retro". The name really says it all, what should we start doing? what should we stop doing? what do we do well that we should keep doing? It is very easy to generate actions from as you have things to stop and start, and it also helps people focus on things that are going well. Examples from previous retros include:

Things you could start: 

* rotating the facilitator
* writing tests in the  Given, When, Then style
* start writing more blog posts
* being on time for stand-up
	
Things to continue:

* improving monitoring
* speeding up CI system
* practicing TDD katas
	
Things to stop:

* long stand-ups
* releasing with failing tests
* working on more than one ticket at once
	
As for any agile retrospective it is helpful to have an external facilitator; we don't have scrum masters. I personally don't believe you need a scrum master, any responsible adult should be able to facilitate a meeting and it is nice to give everyone on the wider team a chance to learn new skills and learn from other teams retros. Facilitation is a topic for another blog post, but quickly - A facilitator should chair the meeting, ensure people don't go off topic, give everyone a chance to speak, watch the clock, write down actions or experiments put forward, and ensure it does not become a talking shop with no outputs.

## Not Getting Enough Ideas?

Suggest that everyone write down at least 1 post-it for each topic(stop,start, cont.). Unless you have a very quiet team you should get more than this. Place them all on the board then cluster and vote.

You can mix this up so it is not the same old retro, ask for 2 starts to get new ideas flowing; or min of 3 continues if you wish to emphasise the good work happening in the team; or 3 things to stop if you want them to focus on defects in their current process.

We get our ideas, filter them by a dot voting or the biggest cluster when we group them.

Then we discuss and get some actions to try in the next iteration.

Rinse, repeat, enjoy!
